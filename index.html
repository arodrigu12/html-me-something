        <p>Anyone who has lived in Florida for a while, has faced, at one time or another, the prospect of having to
            repair or rebuild the roof after a direct hit by a major storm. Florida, because of its geographical
            location, is all too vulnerable to the yearly onslaught of dangerous hurricanes that take direct aim at the
            Caribbean. This guide contains critical tips to follow when rebuilding/repairing the roof.</p>

                <h2>1. roof deck and attachment</h2>
                <p>
                    Install a roof deck of solid 5/8 inch plywood to maximize wind resistance. Use 10 penny common or 8
                    penny ring shank nails spaced 6 inches apart along the edges of the panel and in the field of the
                    plywood panel. Look in the attic to make sure that the roof decking is properly nailed to the roof
                    framing.

                <h2>2. secondary water barrier</h2>
                <p>
                    Install modified polymer bitumen strips or self-adhering flashing tape on top of the joints in
                    your roof deck; this will keep out the rain if the roof covering is damaged. In addition,
                    install one layer of #30 felt paper over the roof decking and secondary water barrier.

                <h2>3. roof covering</h2>
                <p>
                    Install roof covering rated for wind and hail according to standards <span>astm d 3161</span> or
                    <span>ul 2390</span> for wind resistance and <span>ul 2218</span> for impact resistance. Insist
                    on these standards and look for labels on the products themselves.

                <h2>4. roof shape and bracing gabled ends</h2>
                <p>
                    The type and shape of the roof determines how well it performs during a severe storm. A hipped
                    roof performs better in windstorms than a gabled roof because of aerodynamic considerations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>balloon framing</h3>
                    Use full-height studs, concrete or solid masonry walls from the floor below all the way to the
                    roof. Balloon-framed gable end walls are stronger in severe weather.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>platform framing</h3>
                    Brace the intersection of the gable and end wall. This intersection is a particularly weak point
                    that can collapse in high winds if not properly secured with a brace. In home with attics, an attic floor or ceiling diaphragm properly braced can be used to provide the lateral support of the gable end wall, if the end wall is not framed full height.
                </p>

                <h2>5. roof to wall connections</h2>
                <p>
                    The roof is the first line of defense from a storm. To make sure the roof stays in place under duress, anchor the roof to the wall securely by installing hurricane straps at every wall-to-rafter connection.
